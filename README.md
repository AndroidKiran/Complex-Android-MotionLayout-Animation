Android solution using only **MotionLayout** and **Material Components** library. 

No custom components or views.

### Explanations

Originally we have 5 imageViews which holding pizza images.

If there will be more than 5 pizzas they will change between itselfs with some nasty code solution.

Also, same carousel can be done with *RecyclewView*, *SnapHelper* and *Custom ItemDecorator*.

Dragging toppings can be done via *DragAndDrop* methods available in Android, but I'm lazy to do this.
